Flaskr (Flask tutorial) continued...  with homework
>>>>>>> flaskrc/part2

This repository pick up from where flask tutorial ([the Flaskr blog application](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/) ) left up. You can find the original git repository [here](https://github.com/pallets/flask/tree/1.1.2/examples/tutorial)

At the end of the tutorial you're left with some "homework": suggestions to extend the blog application and improve your skills. 

In this repository I'll do my best to fullfil those suggestions:

* A detail view to show a single post. Click a postâ€™s title to go to its page.

* Like / unlike a post.

* Comments.

* Tags. Clicking a tag shows all the posts with that tag.

* A search box that filters the index page by name.

* Paged display. Only show 5 posts per page.

* Upload an image to go along with a post.

* Format posts using Markdown.

* An RSS feed of new posts.


For installation the same suggestion of Flask's team applies.

Install *(from the original Flask github repository)*
-------

**Be sure to use the same version of the code as the version of the docs
you're reading.** You probably want the latest tagged version, but the
default Git version is the master branch. ::

    # clone the repository
    $ git clone https://github.com/giuliodn/flaskr_continued
    $ cd flaskr_continued
    # checkout the correct version
    $ git tag  # shows the tagged versions
    $ git checkout latest-tag-found-above
    $ cd examples/tutorial

Create a virtualenv and activate it::

    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate

Or on Windows cmd::

    $ py -3 -m venv venv
    $ venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Install Flaskr::

    $ pip install -e .

Or if you are using the master branch, install Flask from source before
installing Flaskr::

    $ pip install -e ../..
    $ pip install -e .

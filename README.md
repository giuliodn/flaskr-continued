# Flaskr... continued
Flaskr (Flask tutorial) continued...  with homework

This repository pick up from where flask tutorial ([the Flaskr blog application](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/) ) left up.

At the end of the tutorial you're left with some "homework": suggestions to extend the blog application and improve your skills. 

In this repository I'll do my best to fullfil those suggestions and at the same time add some more features and change (improve ?) the aspect of the application.
For the latest I'll use the popular framework **Boostrap (vers. 4)** to change the appearence of the blog.

Here's the list of Flask's team suggestions:

* A detail view to show a single post. Click a postâ€™s title to go to its page.

* Like / unlike a post.

* Comments.

* Tags. Clicking a tag shows all the posts with that tag.

* A search box that filters the index page by name.

* Paged display. Only show 5 posts per page.

* Upload an image to go along with a post.

* Format posts using Markdown.

* An RSS feed of new posts.


And this is the list of my extensions:


* New appearance using Boostrap framework

* Extend user personal informations

* Add user avatar

* Deploy on serverless structure
